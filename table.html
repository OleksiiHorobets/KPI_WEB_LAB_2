            Treasure Island is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert
            Louis Stevenson, telling a story of "buccaneers and buried gold". It
            is considered a coming-of-age story and is noted for its atmosphere,
            characters, and action. The novel was originally serialised from
            1881 to 1882 in the children's magazine Young Folks, under the title
            Treasure Island or the Mutiny of the Hispaniola, credited to the
            pseudonym "Captain George North". It was first published as a book
            on 14 November 1883 by Cassell & Co. It has since become one of the
            most often dramatized and adapted of all novels, in numerous media.
            Since its publication, Treasure Island has had significant influence
            on depictions of pirates in popular culture, including elements such
            as deserted tropical islands, treasure maps marked with an "X", and
            one-legged seamen with parrots perched on their shoulders. It is
