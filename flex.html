                Treasure Island is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert
                Louis Stevenson, telling a story of "buccaneers and buried
                gold". It is considered a coming-of-age story and is noted for
                its atmosphere, characters, and action. The novel was originally
                serialised from 1881 to 1882 in the children's magazine Young
                Folks, under the title Treasure Island or the Mutiny of the
                Hispaniola, credited to the pseudonym "Captain George North". It
                was first published as a book on 14 November 1883 by Cassell &
                Co. It has since become one of the most often dramatized and
                adapted of all novels, in numerous media. Since its publication,
                Treasure Island has had significant influence on depictions of
                pirates in popular culture, including elements such as deserted
                tropical islands, treasure maps marked with an "X", and
                one-legged seamen with parrots perched on their shoulders. It is
