        Treasure Island is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert Louis
        Stevenson, telling a story of "buccaneers and buried gold". It is
        considered a coming-of-age story and is noted for its atmosphere,
        characters, and action. The novel was originally serialised from 1881 to
        1882 in the children's magazine Young Folks, under the title Treasure
        Island or the Mutiny of the Hispaniola, credited to the pseudonym
        "Captain George North". It was first published as a book on 14 November
        1883 by Cassell & Co. It has since become one of the most often
        dramatized and adapted of all novels, in numerous media. Since its
        publication, Treasure Island has had significant influence on depictions
        of pirates in popular culture, including elements such as deserted
        tropical islands, treasure maps marked with an "X", and one-legged
        seamen with parrots perched on their shoulders. It is considered a
